            <p>As one of the most important industries in Taiwan, the Department of Information Technology is the only top university in Central Taiwan, and it is our mission to cultivate the most advanced information industry professionals in the country. In order to cultivate a full range of information talents with the knowledge of information theory, hardware, software, network multimedia and information application, the department's curriculum is planned to focus on the following five major areas: network multimedia, embedded systems, intelligent systems, Internet of Things and cloud computing, and information security.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The curriculum emphasizes both theoretical and practical courses, such as "Logic Design", "Operating Systems", and "Electronic Circuitry" with "Logic Design Lab", "Operating Systems Lab", and "Electronic Circuitry Lab"; and "Information Special Topics" is a required course to cultivate information professionals with theoretical foundation and practical skills.</li>
                <li>First, the Department's basic programming courses are divided into two semesters: "Computer Programming" in the first semester and "Object-Oriented Programming" in the second semester, so that students can develop basic programming skills during the academic year. In addition, the department offers several programming courses in the sophomore, junior, and senior years, such as Combined Language and System Programming, Windows Environment Programming, Unix System and Script Programming, Network Programming, and Smartphone Application Development. Students are also encouraged to participate in programming competitions and university programming competency examinations (CPE) to further enhance their programming skills. The department also invites Professor Wu Yonghui from Fudan University to visit the department during the summer and winter to train students' programming skills.</li>
                <li>In response to the trend of the cloud industry, the Department and the Department of Applied Mathematics have cooperated to establish the "Cloud Computing and Services Program" in the Graduate School, which has enabled the Department to cultivate talents in cloud computing and huge data analysis since 2011 and to participate in national competitions, winning many awards and achieving remarkable results.</li>
                <li>The department requires that faculty members' teaching subjects be integrated with their areas of academic research and practical experience. Therefore, all courses are offered according to the faculty members' expertise. At the same time, faculty members will apply their latest knowledge and achievements in research and practical experience in teaching to enhance the enjoyment and effectiveness of students' learning.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The department's curriculum is planned and designed to implement students' core competencies and to uphold the spirit of "theory and application" and "depth and breadth" in order to lay the theoretical foundation and practical ability of students in the field of information technology, and to enhance and expand the depth and breadth of students' information technology, with the ultimate goal of promoting the development of information-related industries in the central region and the country.</p>
            <p>The promotion of "knowledge-based economy" has become an important direction for future economic development, and highly qualified information personnel are especially indispensable for the knowledge-based economy. The Department of Information Technology, as the only top university in Central Taiwan, aims to cultivate the most advanced information industry talents in the country. Based on this philosophy, the department has set the following educational objectives and core competencies for students based on the educational objectives and according to the academic structure.</p>
